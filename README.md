This code combines a binomial queue and hashing. The binomoal que is the bulk of the code, and figuring out how to sort, insert and remove from the queue. The insert functions take in either an Rvalue or a regular parameter and creates a new binomial queue with the parameter, mergers it with the current binomial queue, and then adds it into the hash table in order to keep everything reachable and neat. The code then is able find a binomialnode from within the hash table, as well as being able to remove binomial nodes from within the hash table, and the binomial queue itself.
